## Overview

TORTUS represents a pilot initiative in the application of artificial intelligence to healthcare documentation. The tool is specifically designed to address the administrative burden that often reduces the time healthcare professionals can spend in direct patient interaction.^[1]^

The system operates by automating the creation of clinical documentation, including:
- Clinic notes
- Patient correspondence letters
- Administrative documentation

## Development and Implementation

TORTUS is being piloted by the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust as part of their digital transformation initiatives. The development and implementation is overseen by the GOSH Data Research, Innovation and Virtual Environments (DRIVE) unit, which focuses on leveraging technology to improve patient care and clinical efficiency.^[1]^

### Organizational Context

Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, commonly known as GOSH, is a leading pediatric hospital in the United Kingdom. The hospital has been at the forefront of adopting innovative technologies to enhance patient care and operational efficiency.

## Technology

TORTUS utilizes several artificial intelligence methodologies to achieve its clinical documentation objectives:

### Core Technologies
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The primary technology enabling the system to understand and generate human-readable clinical text
- **Additional AI Methods**: The system incorporates other unspecified AI technologies to enhance its documentation capabilities^[1]^

### Technical Implementation
The tool is designed to integrate with existing clinical workflows, allowing healthcare professionals to maintain their standard practices while benefiting from automated documentation support.

## Benefits and Impact

The implementation of TORTUS is expected to deliver several key benefits to both healthcare providers and patients:

### Clinical Benefits
- **Increased Face-to-Face Time**: By automating documentation tasks, clinicians can dedicate more time to direct patient interaction^[1]^
- **Improved Patient Experience**: Enhanced quality of patient-clinician interactions due to reduced administrative distractions^[1]^
- **Enhanced Clinical Focus**: Allows healthcare professionals to concentrate on core clinical activities rather than administrative tasks^[1]^

### Operational Benefits
- **Automated Documentation**: Streamlines the creation of clinic notes and patient correspondence^[1]^
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Reduces the time burden associated with manual documentation processes^[1]^

## Current Status

As of November 2024, TORTUS is in the pilot phase of development and implementation at Great Ormond Street Hospital.^[1]^ The pilot program allows the hospital to evaluate the tool's effectiveness and refine its capabilities before potential broader deployment.
