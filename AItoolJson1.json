Next Steps Guidance: If the forecasted income falls short of the user's desired lifestyle, the tool provides actionable advice on how to bridge the gap. It suggests increasing contributions, delaying retirement, or making other adjustments. Flexibility and Scenario Planning: The tool enables users to simulate different financial scenarios by adjusting key parameters (e.g., retirement age, contribution amounts, lump sums). Clear Illustration of Shortfalls or Surpluses: The tool visually represents whether a user's estimated retirement income will meet, exceed, or fall short of their target.
