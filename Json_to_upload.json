"text": "# Consult\n\n<a id="overview"></a>\n\n**Consult** is a UK government AI tool developed by the Incubator for AI (i.AI) in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to analyse public consultation responses at scale. It applies large language models to extract themes, map them to individual responses, and present dashboards to policy teams. The tool is currently in a pre-deployment/pilot phase and is recorded on the Government Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS).^[1]^^[2]^^[3]^\n\n---\n\n## Contents\n* [Overview](#overview)\n* [Benefits & Impact](#benefits)\n* [History & Development](#history)\n* [Technology & Technical Details](#technology)\n* [Implementation & Deployment](#implementation)\n* [Current Users & Deployments](#users)\n* [Partnerships & Collaborations](#partnerships)\n* [Privacy, Safety & Compliance](#privacy)\n* [Media Coverage & Recognition](#media)\n* [Future Developments](#future)\n* [Challenges & Considerations](#challenges)\n* [Technical Resources](#technical)\n* [Performance Metrics](#metrics)\n* [Case Studies](#cases)\n* [Metadata](#metadata)\n* [References](#references)\n\n---\n\n<a id="benefits"></a>\n\n## Benefits & Impact\n\n- **Speed and cost efficiency:** Internal testing reported on the ATRS indicates **Consult is 400× cheaper and over 120× faster** than a manual baseline on a representative sample (3 minutes vs 6 hours), while eliminating recorded procedural errors observed in human labelling.^[1]^  Ministers and coverage around the initial trial have also referenced claims of up to **1,000× faster** analysis in public communications.^[8]^^[7]^\n- **Productivity and capacity:** DSIT estimates that across ~500 consultations per year, Consult could help save **~75,000 analyst days annually**, equating to **about £20 million** in staffing costs if adopted at scale.^[4]^  The tool aims to shift analysts’ time from mechanical categorisation toward higher-value interpretation.^[3]^^[2]^\n- **Consistency and auditability:** A standardised pipeline (sentiment → topic generation → consolidation/refinement → mapping) supports repeatable analysis and JSON-structured outputs to aid review.^[1]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="history"></a>\n\n## History & Development\n\n- **Origin:** Incubated by **i.AI** within DSIT to reduce the burden of manual coding of consultation responses and shorten feedback cycles.^[2]^^[3]^\n- **ATRS publication:** The tool was entered into the **GOV.UK Algorithmic Transparency** register on **14 May 2025** with detailed purpose, ownership, model information and risks/mitigations.^[1]^\n- **Public evaluation blog:** i.AI published an explainer and early evaluation notes describing how Consult identifies themes and maps them back to responses for analyst review.^[3]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="technology"></a>\n\n## Technology & Technical Details\n\n- **Architecture & pipeline:** Consult orchestrates a sequence of LLM prompts to perform **sentiment analysis**, **topic generation**, **topic consolidation/refinement**, and **topic mapping**, enforcing **JSON output integrity checks** and employing batched prompting with retry/back-off to handle rate limits.^[1]^\n- **Model & hosting:** The ATRS specifies **GPT-4o hosted on Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service (internal instance)**, with API version noted as **2024-02-01**.^[1]^\n- **Open-source components:** The underlying topic-modelling capability is published as **ThemeFinder** (MIT-licensed), and an application repository for **Consult** is also available; both are maintained under the **i-dot-ai** GitHub organisation.^[13]^^[14]^  i.AI’s public pages and reporting further describe ThemeFinder as the capability that powers Consult.^[6]^^[9]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="implementation"></a>\n\n## Implementation & Deployment\n\n- **Phase:** The ATRS lists Consult as **pre-deployment** with a limited number of internal test users and no direct citizen interaction.^[1]^\n- **Operating model:** Consult is positioned as an **assistive analytical aide** whose outputs complement, not replace, human expert analysis in consultation reporting.^[1]^  Delivery and maintenance currently sit with **i.AI**, with potential handover to wider government digital teams post-deployment.^[1]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="users"></a>\n\n## Current Users & Deployments\n\n### Live Trials / First Use\n- **Scottish Government** – Used to analyse responses to the consultation on regulating **non-surgical cosmetic procedures**, with results described as closely matching human expert analysis; reported as the **first real-world test** on **14 May 2025**.^[4]^^[5]^^[17]^  Media coverage reiterated the trial and projected savings/efficiency claims.^[8]^^[6]^\n\n### Anticipated Adoption\n- DSIT has indicated ambition for **wider rollout across UK departments** following further evaluation to assure accuracy and efficiency ahead of final decisions.^[4]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="partnerships"></a>\n\n## Partnerships & Collaborations\n\n- **Model provider relationship:** Public communications around the **UK Government–OpenAI strategic partnership** (July 2025) and sector coverage state that **GPT-4o powers Consult**, aligning with the ATRS specification of GPT-4o on Azure OpenAI.^[12]^^[10]^^[11]^  (ATRS explicitly records GPT-4o on an internal Azure OpenAI instance.)^[1]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="privacy"></a>\n\n## Privacy, Safety & Compliance\n\n- **Transparency & accountability:** Consult is documented in the **ATRS** with extensive fields covering ownership, scope, data, model details, risks and mitigations.^[1]^\n- **Risk posture:** The ATRS notes risks including **opacity of proprietary models**, domain-specific terminology comprehension, and the need for **human-in-the-loop validation**; mitigations include contextualising prompts, providing guidance in the UI, and treating outputs as advisory.^[1]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="media"></a>\n\n## Media Coverage & Recognition\n\n- **Government announcement:** DSIT announced first use of the **Humphrey** AI toolkit (of which Consult is a component) to review consultation responses and outlined potential savings.^[4]^\n- **Specialist press:** Coverage by **Civil Service World** and **UKAuthority** reported early results and linked Consult to ThemeFinder and i.AI’s broader AI portfolio.^[5]^^[6]^\n- **Mainstream press:** **The Guardian** highlighted the planned rollout, claimed speed gains, and later discussed concerns over reliance on large tech vendors as deployment scales.^[8]^^[16]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="future"></a>\n\n## Future Developments\n\n- **Planned scale-up:** Further evaluation work is planned to validate **accuracy and efficiency** before **department-wide rollout** decisions.^[4]^  Public reporting suggests continued integration within the wider **Humphrey** suite and growth of Azure-hosted LLM capabilities in government.^[4]^^[11]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="challenges"></a>\n\n## Challenges & Considerations\n\n- **Vendor dependence and ecosystem risk:** Commentary notes risks around reliance on major AI providers and the importance of commercial terms, safeguards and oversight as AI tooling becomes embedded.^[16]^\n- **Bias and robustness:** External experts have urged caution regarding potential **bias**, **manipulation**, and **error risks**, reinforcing the need for strong evaluation and guardrails.^[8]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="technical"></a>\n\n## Technical Resources\n\n- **GitHub – ThemeFinder:** i-dot-ai/themefinder (MIT) – topic modelling package that underpins Consult.^[13]^\n- **GitHub – Consult:** i-dot-ai/consult – application repository and data import guidance.^[14]^\n- **i.AI Knowledge Hub – Use case page:** Links and context for Consult and ThemeFinder.^[9]^\n- **House of Commons Library briefing:** Overview of AI in departments including **Consult**’s role.^[15]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="metrics"></a>\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\n- **400× cheaper; 120× faster:** ATRS efficiency comparison (3 minutes vs 6 hours on the sample), and removal of observed procedural errors found in human labelling.^[1]^\n- **Scale savings projection:** ~**75,000 analyst days** and **~£20m** per year across ~500 consultations, contingent on broader adoption.^[4]^\n- **Indicative cost of a major pilot:** Reporting cited a **cost under £50** for the Scottish Government pilot’s AI processing, illustrating low marginal costs at small scale (media claim).^[16]^\n\n---\n\n<a id="cases"></a>\n\n## Case Studies\n\n- **Scottish Government – Non-surgical cosmetic procedures (2025):** Consult processed >2,000 responses, with automated themes reviewed by experts;
